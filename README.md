## The idea of this project:
The idea of the application is to help the user manage his tasks on a regular basis and comfortably, as the application will help him to add every task he wants to accomplish and when he completes it he puts a check mark on it. The application enables the user to delete or modify the task if he wishes to do so.

## The journey during the coding of this project:
At the start of the project we all agreed on a certain time to meet and divide the tasks between each of contributors we also had to agree on certain viewport like the iPhone x width of 375 pixels, also we created the repository everyone creates an issue putting into detail the steps taken to complete the project in Git-hub while also adding the contributors to the project this allows all of them to access the repository where they can clone the files, make edits, add, commit, and push the edited files using the work flow (Git-Bash). After pushing the files the contributors create a pull request with a tag of “awaiting review” after checking the codes of each contributor and resolving all the conflicts the lead mentor allows the code to get merged. Finally, the project is published on Git-hub.
